## to clone run ```git clone https://github.com/Silentmussle913/leviLamina-WebUI.git```
for more details dm ``silentmussle`` in discord. 
this is a forked repo of my original program [Bds-manager](https://github.com/Silentmussle913/BDS-Manager)
my original is for a normal Bds server but this is just slightly modified to run with the bedrock_server_mod.exe rather than the old bedrock_server.exe (in normal bds).
